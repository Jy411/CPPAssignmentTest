untested function
need to be put in the main file(?)

--------------------------------------------------
made based on the assumptions that a line in the "student_record.txt" shows as follows

|-----student details------|         |-----------------scores-----------------|
no firstname lastname gender classID bm english math history moral bio chem phy
                                                                  |-replaced---|
                                                                  |--if they---|
                                                                  |-are in art-|

students are differentiated based on their classID
classID has a length of 6 digit
the 3rd digit of classID determines which class is it (lower/science/art = 1/2/3)
